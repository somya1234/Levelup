1. l002 - Q 1020 - complexity of gcc ? - cant be 4(^n), maybe 2^n or n2.
                    overall complexity ->?

2. l002 -> Q 1021 - Shortest Path iN binary matrix , time complexity -> n2? ya kuch better hui dp se?
             I think n hogi kyuki at max O(n), in worst case it will travel , along corner cells
             and if all are fill then to diagonal se jayega bs shortest path se,  as non-cyclic BFS.

3. grid[0].length==0 ? when grid.length=0 (how?)
